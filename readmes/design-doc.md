## 📘 Design Document: Job Queue Management Platform

---

### 1. 📟 Overview

**Project Name**: Job Queue Management Platform  
**Author**: [Your Name]  
**Date**: [Date]  
**Version**: 1.0

This project provides a scalable and modular platform for handling background jobs asynchronously using BullMQ, Redis, TypeScript, and Docker. It includes RESTful APIs for job management, a worker service to process jobs, and optional monitoring via a dashboard.

---

### 2. 🌟 Goals

- Asynchronous background job handling
- Job lifecycle tracking (waiting, active, failed, completed)
- Scalable and fault-tolerant processing
- Modular, OOP-compliant codebase
- Developer-friendly observability and documentation

---

### 3. 🧰 Architecture Overview

#### System Components:

- **Client** → REST API → **Redis Queue** (BullMQ) ↔ **Worker Service** → External Job Logic
- **Database** for job metadata
- **Optional Dashboard** for monitoring

---

### 4. ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Component     | Tech                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Language      | TypeScript              |
| Web Framework | Express / Fastify       |
| Queue         | BullMQ (Redis-based)    |
| Database      | PostgreSQL              |
| ORM           | Prisma / TypeORM        |
| Container     | Docker + Docker Compose |
| Dashboard     | React (Optional)        |

---

### 5. 📆 Modules

1. **Job API**: Handles job submission, status queries.
2. **Worker Service**: Connects to queue, processes jobs.
3. **Database**: Tracks job metadata and lifecycle.
4. **Dashboard (Optional)**: UI for job monitoring.

---

### 6. 🔍 Job Lifecycle

1. Client submits job via `/jobs` endpoint
2. API writes metadata to DB
3. Job is pushed to Redis queue (BullMQ)
4. Worker fetches job and executes logic
5. Status updated in DB
6. Result viewable via API or Dashboard

---

### 7. 🧬 Entities and Use Cases

#### Entities:

- **Job**
  - id, type, data, status, timestamps

#### Use Cases:

- `SubmitJobUseCase`
- `RetryJobUseCase`
- `ListJobsUseCase`
- `GetJobStatusUseCase`

---

### 8. 📡 API Design

#### POST `/jobs`

```json
{
  "type": "send_email",
  "data": {
    "to": "john@example.com",
    "subject": "Hello",
    "body": "Welcome!"
  }
}
```

#### GET `/jobs/:id`

Returns job status by ID.

#### GET `/jobs`

Filters: type, status, date.

---

### 9. 🚀 Infrastructure

#### Docker Compose Services:

- `api`
- `worker`
- `redis`
- `postgres`
- `dashboard` (optional)

---

### 10. 🔒 Security

- Request validation with Zod/Joi
- Rate limiting and CORS
- Authentication middleware (optional)

---

### 11. 📊 Scalability

- Stateless microservices
- Worker concurrency tuning
- Sharded queues for heavy loads
- Pluggable job types

---

### 12. ✅ Testing

- Unit tests for use cases and entities
- Integration tests for queue/DB flow
- E2E tests for job lifecycle

---
